# OnPrem
The client in the hospital

## Architecture

We designed an architecture with two main components: OnPrem to be hosted on a dedicated hardware box within each hospital, and OffPrem to be hosted on the cloud to manage research. 

We use diagrams.net to create up-to-date versions of the system architecture. [View it here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1LZMk2MhV1ZCx0Fs_YksQ0VIhux2FbPjH). Only contributors added to the Medley Health organization are able to edit the document.
